	// Place your snippets for c here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Doxygen function": {
		"prefix": "dox",
		"body": [
			"/**",
			"	@brief $1",
			""
			"	@param $2" 
			""
			"	@retval 0 if successful, 1 if errors occured"
			"*/"
